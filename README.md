# Loan-Prediction-Analysis
🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a predictive model to assess the probability of loan approval based on customer attributes. The goal is to help financial institutions automate the credit risk assessment process by providing a data-driven decision support system.

🎯 Objective
Build a machine learning model to predict whether a loan will be approved or rejected.
Analyze key factors that affect loan approval.
Deliver actionable insights to improve the loan approval process.

🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries & Tools:
 • NumPy, Pandas for data manipulation
 • Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
 • scikit-learn for building machine learning models
 • Jupyter Notebook for interactive development
